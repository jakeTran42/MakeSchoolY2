# Custom Authenticated API Project

It's time to get creative and write the authenticated API of your dreams!

## Objectives

1. Practice the SDLC by **completing a project from proposal to deployment** with a **focus on Test Driven Development** practices.
1. **Utilize all the techniques learned** in class **in a single cohesive project**.
1. Produce a **portfolio-worthy authenticated API** to show off to the world!

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. At least one **nested route or resource**.
1. The ability to **CREATE**, **READ**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** the object(s) in your API.
1. At least **one of each** endpoint: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.
1. A **database persistence layer** (e.g. MongoDB)
1. Project **contains documentation** explaining how to use your API.
1. Project contains a **simple, static single page brochure site** that explains what the API does and a link to the API's documentation.


### Non-Functional Requirements

1. The API must be written using the **appropriate application of RESTful techniques**.
1. The API implementation must **follow the MVC pattern**.
1. The API must be hosted in a **public GitHub repository**.
1. The project repository **should not expose any secrets**!
1. The API must have a discernible theme or **serve a distinct purpose**. See the [Examples](#Examples) for well-themed and purposed APIs.
1. The final project must be **deployed and fully accessible** via the internet and **callable via any consumer**.
1. The final project must be **fully documented**.

### Level Up - API + Skills (_Optional_)

**NOTE**: `++` indicates the ability to level up the preceding skill through the following stretch challenges:

1. **`Code++`**: Love integrations? Find a clever way to **utilize a third-party API _within_ your API**!
1. **`DevOps++`**: Deploy API and brochure site over **HTTPS**.
1. **`Networking++`**: Write and **post a short blog** on Medium, Hacker News, or dev.to debuting and promoting your life-changing new API! Sign up now!

## Example APIs

* [List of Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) - Giant list of public APIs to inspire you!
* [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com) - Excellent single page brochure site with easy to find About and Documentation links. Very clear documentation.
* [Adorable Avatars](http://avatars.adorable.io) - Beautiful brochure site, easy to use and direct API. Great docs and FAQ!
* [JSONPlaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) - Clean and minimalist one page site and documentation for a very simple API. Love the 'Try It!' buttons!

### Heroku Deployment

* Make sure the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is set to `*` so that requests to your API can be made from any domain!
